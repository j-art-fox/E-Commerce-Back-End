# E-Commerce-Back-End
## Description
This application was created to portray how one can combine a database assembled with sequelize with an express-based backend to create a fully operational api with SQL databases. With this application one can view, update, create and delete data in a database using CRUD methods.Through this project, I had to figure out how to use Sequelize to create models, route api calls, and seed data into a database. The most difficult part of this project for me was making sure to maintain the same functionality with async functions that also properly check for errors instead of using promises and .then methods.
